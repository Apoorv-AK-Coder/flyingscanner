                <p>A2Z Flight Service LLC is a dedicated team of travel professionals committed to transforming your travel plans into seamless, affordable, and stress-free experiences. We believe that every journey, whether a family vacation to a sun-drenched beach, a crucial business meeting across the country, a last-minute trip to a cousin’s wedding, or a romantic getaway, should begin with ease and excitement. Our core mission is to provide you with access to cheap flight tickets on your preferred airlines without compromising on service or reliability. From A to Z, we handle it all.</p>
                <p>We recognize that life is beautifully unpredictable. While this makes it exciting, it can also lead to sudden changes in even the most carefully made plans. A meeting gets postponed, a family emergency arises, or a personal event forces a change of dates. In these moments, having a flexible and understanding travel partner makes all the difference. That’s why when you book your flights with A2Z Flight Service LLC, you’re not just securing an economical fare; you’re investing in peace of mind, backed by a transparent cancellation and refund policy designed to protect you.</p>
                <p>Our expert travel agents are your single point of contact for all your travel needs. They will diligently work to find the best deals for you and, if your plans change, will guide you through the process of securing a refund should you be eligible for one.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Understanding Your Refund Eligibility</h3>
                <p>Navigating airline policies can be complex, but we simplify it for you. Your eligibility for a refund primarily depends on the fare type you purchased and the timing of your cancellation.</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><b>24-Hour Risk-Free Cancellation: </b>In accordance with many airline policies and regulations, you are eligible for a complete 100% refund if you cancel your flight ticket within 24 hours of booking, provided that the booking was made at least one week (168 hours) before the scheduled departure time.</li>
                    <li><b>Flexible Fare Tickets: </b>Tickets purchased under a "Flexible" or "Refundable" fare class are fully refundable for a period up until the departure of your flight. This option provides maximum flexibility for travelers who anticipate potential changes.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Refundable Tickets: </b>This is the most common fare type. While these tickets are typically not eligible for a cash refund outside of the 24-hour window, they often can be changed or canceled for a future travel credit. The amount of credit you receive depends on how far in advance you cancel.</li>
                    <li><b>A key rule of thumb: </b>The earlier you cancel your ticket, the higher the value of your refund or future flight credit will be. Last-minute cancellations often result in minimal or no credit.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h3>Our Detailed Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p>To ensure complete clarity, please review the following policy details that apply to bookings made through A2Z Flight Service LLC:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><b>Refundable Tickets: </b>Tickets bought at a "Flexible" fare can be canceled prior to the scheduled flight's departure for a full refund to the original form of payment.</li>
                    <li><b>24-Hour Rule: </b>Tickets canceled within 24 hours of booking are eligible for a full refund, provided the booking was made at least 7 days prior to the departure of the first flight on your itinerary.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Refundable Tickets & Future Flight Credits: </b>Non-refundable tickets may be changed or canceled prior to departure to receive a courtesy credit towards a future flight, subject to availability and a Administrative Service Fee (typically ranging from $25.00 - $50.00 per passenger per segment).
                        <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Reservations made using a future flight credit are subject to any difference in fare for the new travel dates.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Cancellations must be made at least 2-4 hours prior to the scheduled departure (varies by airline) to receive a credit equivalent to the value of the ticket, less the airline's change fee and any fare difference.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 20px;">These courtesy credits are usually valid for travel within 365 days from the original date of booking.</li>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Important: </b>Passengers who fail to cancel their flight before departure (becoming a "no-show") typically forfeit their entire ticket value and are not eligible for any refund or future credit. Courtesy credits issued for future travel have no cash value.</li>
                    <li><b>Airline Policies Supersede: </b>Tickets bought under specific restrictive fare classes may not be eligible for any refund or credit. All cancellations and refunds are subject to the rules of the operating airline's tariff guidelines. The A2Z Flight Service LLC team will clearly communicate these terms at the time of booking.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A2Z Flight Service LLC, on behalf of the airlines, will endeavor to process all eligible refunds within the standard timeframes. For tickets purchased within the U.S. with a credit card, refunds are typically processed back to your card within 7-10 business days after we receive all required information. Please note that tickets involving another airline, tickets purchased outside the U.S., or bookings made through third-party agencies may require special handling and can take up to one or two billing cycles (45-60 days) to process.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>1. Can I get a 100% refund on flight cancellation?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can receive a 100% refund if you cancel your flight ticket within the 24-hour grace period from the time of booking, as long as your flight was scheduled to depart at least 7 days later. This is your most secure window for a full refund.</p>
                <h3>2. What if I have a medical emergency?</h3>
                <p>We understand that medical emergencies are unforeseen and stressful. If you or an immediate family member experiences a serious medical condition that prevents travel, you may be eligible for a refund or waiver of fees. Each airline has its own policy for medical waivers. Our agents will guide you through the process, which will require supporting documentation, such as a doctor's note or medical certificate, along with your flight details. We will advocate on your behalf with the airline to secure the best possible outcome.</p>
                <h3>3. Can I change my flight dates instead of canceling?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely. In most cases, changing your flight dates is a more economical option than canceling outright, especially with non-refundable tickets. Our agents can handle the change for you, applying the value of your existing ticket towards the new booking, subject to any fare difference and change fees.</p>
                <p>Let A2Z Flight Service LLC be your guide to the skies. We provide the deals you want and the support you need, ensuring your travel experience is exceptional from start to finish. Contact us today and discover the difference a professional and caring travel agency can make.</p>
